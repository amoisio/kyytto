# What?

When I start a new project, or a job or something, I face the same kind of issues when 
trying to stay organized.

- There is always something new to learn
    - I typically list these down as subjects and then start learning. 
    - To learn a subject I collect some basic resources such as hyperlinks to 
        data, simple notes

resource / learning objective
    links : string[]
    notes : string[] (just a string?)

- There is always a need to keep track of things that I need to do (TODO app)
    - Like discuss something with someone
    - Send documents to some person
    - APs from meetings

todo
    - description : string
    - isCompleted : boolean

- There is always a need to keep track of the work that I have done
    - E.g. a short description of what I worked on and how long I worked on it

workItem
    - date : Date
    - description : string
    - hours : number

# How?

This is the whole point. I want to make the use of this app as simple as possible.
Specifically, I want it to work with keyboard shortcuts so that I can do my work without 
needing a keyboard
