# client-vue3

So, I decided to pivot 'Kyytt√∂' toward an application that I would use for tracking work on my personal side-projects.

Requirements:
- A simple Kanban table which includes todo items and in-progress items
    - Later add a project based filter
- A simple way to create new todo items
- A project page for recording project ideas

First task is to build a view where I can add, edit and delete project ideas.
